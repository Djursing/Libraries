In this project we show you how to Animate an Elf on a Shelf with the PivotPi, a Raspberry Pi Servo Controller, making it a smart Elf.  We'll attach a small servo to the Elf's arm to make it wave, we'll use a distance sensor to see if anyone is close to the Elf on a Shelf, and we will tie it all together with the Raspberry Pi and GrovPi Zero.
