''' 
In this project we show you how to Animate an Elf on a Shelf with the PivotPi, a Raspberry Pi Servo Controller, making it a smart Elf.  We'll attach a small servo to the Elf's arm to make it wave, we'll use a distance sensor to see if anyone is close to the Elf on a Shelf, and we will tie it all together with the Raspberry Pi and GrovPi Zero.

When someone approaches, the Elf will begin enthusiastically waving!  This project will demonstrate how to easily add motion to an otherwise lifeless Elf and other toys.

# Connect the Grove Ultrasonic Ranger to digital port D4

# angle(channel, degrees) will set a servo position to roughly the degrees you specify. However
# each servo is different, so if it's calibrated for one servo, it won't be the same for others.
#
# led(channel, percent) will set the LED brightness in percent (0-100). Using a floating point
# percent value will increase the precision if necessary (e.g. 21.2 or 0.075). The PWM scale is 12-bit + 1
# so the 0-100 percent range is divided into 4096 values (about 0.025% per value).

# Initialise the PivotPi servo controller with the right address (0x40 if both switches are low), and the frequency
# that it's actually running at. You can use 60 (target frequency).
